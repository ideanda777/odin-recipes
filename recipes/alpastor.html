    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 whole ancho chiles, seeds and stems removed
        </li>
        <li>2 whole pasilla or guajillo chiles, seeds and stems removed
        </li>
        <li>1 chipotle chile packed in adobo sauce, plus 2 teaspoons sauce from can
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin seed
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chiles in a large saucepan over medium high heat and cook, turning chiles occasionally, until puffed,
            pliable, lightly browned in spots, and very aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock (it should boil
            immediately), then pour contents of pan into a small bowl. Cover loosely and set aside.</li>
        <li>Wipe out saucepan, add oil, and return to medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Add cumin, oregano, and
            achiote and cook, stirring frequently, until aromatic but not browned, about 30 seconds. Add chipotle chiles
            and sauce and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds longer. Add vinegar, salt, and sugar and remove from
            heat.</li>
        <li>Scrape contents of saucepan into a blender along with garlic and chiles with their soaking liquid. Blend on
            high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as necessary. Set sauce aside to
            cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Using a very sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice the meat as thin as possible. If necessary, place
            meat in freezer for 15 minutes to firm it up. Split the sides of a heavy duty zipper-lock bag. Place one
            slice of meat inside bag and pound with the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet or a meat pounder until less
            than 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining meat.</li>
